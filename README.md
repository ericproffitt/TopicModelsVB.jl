# TopicModelsVB.jl
A Julia Package for Variational Bayesian Topic Modeling.

Topic models are concerned with discovering the latent low-dimensional thematic structure within corpora.  Topic models are, at their core, Bayesian hierarchical models, and are most often fit using either [Markov chain Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) (MCMC) methods, or [variational Bayesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods) (VB) methods.  The former approach is slower, but consistent.  Given infinite time, MCMC will fit the desired model exactly.  The latter method is faster (often much faster), but inconsistent, since one must approximate distributions in order to ensure tractability.  This package takes the latter approach to topic modeling.

**Important:** If you find a bug, please don't hesitate to open an issue, I should reply promptly.

## Corpus
Let's begin with the Corpus data structure.  The Corpus data structure has been designed for maximum ease-of-use.  Datasets must still be cleaned and put into the appropriate format, but once a dataset is in the proper format and read into a corpus, it can easily be modified to meet the user's needs.

There are four plaintext files that make up a corpus:
 * docfile
 * lexfile
 * userfile
 * titlefile
 
None of these files are mandatory to read a corpus, and in fact reading no files will result in an empty corpus.  However in order to train a model a docfile will be necessary, since it contains all quantitative data known about the documents.  On the other hand, the lex, user and title files are used solely for interpreting output.

The docfile should be a plaintext file containing lines of delimited numerical values.  Each document is a block of lines, the number of which depends on what information is known about the documents.  Since a document is at its essence a list of terms, each document *must* contain at least one line containing a nonempty list of delimited positive integer values corresponding to the terms of which it is composed.  Any further lines in a document block are optional, however if they are present they must be present for all documents and must come in the following order:

* `terms`: A line of delimited positive integers corresponding to the terms which make up the document (this line is mandatory).

* `counts`: A line of delimited positive integers, equal in length to the term line, corresponding to the number of times a particular term appears in a document (defaults to `ones(length(terms))`).

* `readers`: A line of delimited positive integers corresponding to those users which have read the document.

* `ratings`: A line of delimited positive integers, equal in length to the `readers` line, corresponding to the rating each reader gave the document (defaults to `ones(length(readers))`).

* `stamp`: A numerical value in the range `[-inf, inf]` denoting the timestamp of the document.

An example of a single doc block from a docfile with all possible lines included:

```
...
4,10,3,100,57
1,1,2,1,3
1,9,10
1,1,5
19990112.0
...
```

The lex and user files are dictionaries mapping positive integers to terms and usernames (resp.), they are tab delimited.  For example,

```
1    this
2    is
3    a
4    lex
5    file
```

A userfile is identitcal to a lexfile, except usernames will appear in place of vocabulary terms.

Finally, a titlefile is simply a list of titles, not a dictionary, and is of the form:

```
title1
title2
title3
title4
title5
```

The order of these titles correspond to the order of document blocks in the associated docfile.

To read a corpus into TopicModelsVB.jl, use the following function:

```julia
readcorp(;docfile="", lexfile="", userfile="", titlefile="", delim=',', counts=false, readers=false, ratings=false, stamps=false)
```

The ```file``` keyword arguments indicate the path where the respective file is located.

It is often the case that even once files are correctly formatted and read, the corpus will still contain formatting defects which prevent it from being loaded into a model.  Therefore, before loading a corpus into a model, it is **very important** that one of the following is run:

```julia
fixcorp!(corp; kwargs...)
```

or

```julia
padcorp!(corp; kwargs...)
fixcorp!(corp; kwargs...)
```

Padding a corpus before fixing it will ensure that any documents which contain lex or user keys not in the lex or user dictionaries are not removed.  Instead, generic lex and user keys will be added as necessary to the lex and user dictionaries (resp.).

**Important:** A corpus is only a container for documents.  

Whenever you load a corpus into a model, a copy of that corpus is made, such that if you modify the original corpus at corpus-level (remove documents, re-order lex keys, etc.), this will not affect any corpus attached to a model.  However!  Since corpora are containers for their documents, modifying an individual document will affect this document in all corpora which contain it.  Therefore:

**1. Using `corp!` functions to modify the documents of a corpus will not result in corpus defects, but will cause them also to be changed in all other corpora which contain them.**

**2. Manually modifying documents is dangerous, and can result in corpus defects which cannot be fixed by `fixcorp!`.  It's advised that you don't do this with out a good reason.**

## Tutorial
### LDA
Let's begin our tutorial with a simple latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model with 9 topics, trained on the first 5000 documents from the NSF corpus.

```julia
using TopicModelsVB

srand(1)

nsfcorp = readcorp(:nsf) 

nsfcorp.docs = nsfcorp[1:5000]
fixcorp!(nsfcorp)

# Notice that the post-fix lexicon is smaller after removing all but the first 5000 docs.

nsflda = LDA(nsfcorp, 9)
train!(nsflda, iter=150, tol=0.0) # Setting tol=0.0 will ensure that all 150 iterations are completed.
                                  # If you don't want to watch the ∆elbo, set chkelbo=151.
# training...

showtopics(nsflda, cols=9)
```

```

```

Now that we've trained our LDA model we can, if we want, take a look at the topic proportions for individual documents.  For instance, document 1 has topic breakdown:

```julia
nsflda.gamma[1] # = [0.036, 0.030, 189.312, 0.036, 0.049, 0.022, 8.728, 0.027, 0.025]
```
This vector of topic weights suggests that document 1 is mostly about biology, and in fact looking at the document text confirms this observation:

```julia
showdocs(nsflda, 1) # Could also have done showdocs(nsfcorp, 1).
```

```
 ●●● Doc: 1
 ●●● CRB: Genetic Diversity of Endangered Populations of Mysticete Whales: Mitochondrial DNA and Historical Demography
commercial exploitation past hundred years great extinction variation sizes
populations prior minimal population size current permit analyses effects 
differing levels species distributions life history...
```

On the other hand, some documents will be a combination of topics.  Consider the topic breakdown for document 25:

```julia
nsflda.gamma[25] # = [11.575, 44.889, 0.0204, 0.036, 0.049, 0.022, 0.020, 66.629, 0.025]

showdocs(nsflda, 25)
```

```
 ●●● Doc: 25
 ●●● Mathematical Sciences: Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations from Hydrodynamics
work project continues mathematical research nonlinear elliptic problems arising perfect
fluid hydrodynamics emphasis analytical study propagation waves stratified media techniques
analysis partial differential equations form basis studies primary goals understand nature 
internal presence vortex rings arise density stratification due salinity temperature...
```

We see that in this case document 25 appears to be about applications of mathematical physics to ocean currents, which corresponds precisely to a combination of topics 2 and 8, with a smaller but not insignificant weight on topic 1.

Furthermore, if we want to, we can also generate artificial corpora by using the ```gencorp``` function.  Generating artificial corpora will in turn run the underlying probabilistic graphical model as a generative process in order to produce entirely new collections of documents, let's try it out:

```julia
artifnsfcorp = gencorp(nsflda, 5000, 1e-5) # The third argument governs the amount of Laplace smoothing (defaults to 0.0).

artifnsflda = LDA(artifnsfcorp, 9)
train!(artifnsflda, iter=150, tol=0.0, chkelbo=15)

# training...

showtopics(artifnsflda, cols=9)
```

```
topic 1       topic 2          topic 3       topic 4          topic 5         topic 6         topic 7      topic 8         topic 9

```

One thing we notice so far is that despite producing what are clearly coherent topics, many of the top words in each topic are words such as *research*, *study*, *data*, etc.  While such terms would be considered informative in a generic corpus, they are effectively stop words in a corpus composed of science article abstracts.  Such corpus-specific stop words will be missed by most generic stop word lists, and they can be difficult to pinpoint and individually remove prior to training.  Thus let's change our model to a *filtered* latent Dirichlet allocation (fLDA) model.

```julia
srand(1)

nsfflda = fLDA(nsfcorp, 9)
train!(nsfflda, iter=150, tol=0.0)

# training...

showtopics(nsfflda, cols=9)
```

```

earthquake      flow            species          design           university     cell          economic     theory          chemistry

```

We can now see that many of the most troublesome corpus-specific stop words have been automatically filtered out, while those that remain are those which tend to cluster within their own, more generic, topic.

### CTM
For our final example using the NSF corpus, let's upgrade our model to a filtered *correlated* topic model (fCTM).

```julia
srand(1)

nsffctm = fCTM(nsfcorp, 9)
train!(nsffctm, iter=150, tol=0.0)

# training...

showtopics(nsffctm, 20, cols=9)
```

```

```

Because the topics in the fLDA model were already so well defined, there's little room to improve topic coherence by upgrading to the fCTM model, however what's most interesting about the CTM and fCTM models is the ability to look at topic correlations.

Based on the top 20 terms in each topic, we might tentatively assign the following topic labels:

* topic 1: *Earth Science*
* topic 2: *Physics*
* topic 3: *Sociobiology*
* topic 4: *Computer Science*
* topic 5: *Academia*
* topic 6: *Microbiology*
* topic 7: *Economics*
* topic 8: *Mathematics*
* topic 9: *Chemistry*

Now let's take a look at the topic-covariance matrix:

```julia
nsffctm.sigma

# Top 3 off-diagonal positive entries, sorted in descending order:
nsffctm.sigma[4,8] # 9.532
nsffctm.sigma[3,6] # 7.362
nsffctm.sigma[2,9] # 4.531

# Top 3 negative entries, sorted in ascending order:
nsffctm.sigma[7,9] # -14.627
nsffctm.sigma[3,8] # -12.464
nsffctm.sigma[1,8] # -11.775
```

According to the list above, the most closely related topics are topics 4 and 8, which correspond to the *Computer Science* and *Mathematics* topics, followed closely by 3 and 6, corresponding to the topics *Sociobiology* and *Microbiology*, and then by 2 and 9, corresponding to *Physics* and *Chemistry*.

As for the most unlikely topic pairings, first are topics 7 and 9, corresponding to *Economics* and *Chemistry*, followed closely by topics 1 and 8, corresponding to *Sociobiology* and *Mathematics*, and then third are topics 3 and 8, corresponding to *Earth Science* and *Mathematics*.

Furthermore, as expected, the topic which is least correlated with all other topics is the *Academia* topic:

```julia
sum(abs(nsffctm.sigma[:,5])) - nsffctm.sigma[5,5] # Academia topic, absolute off-diagonal covariance 13.403.
```

**Note:** Both CTM and fCTM will sometimes have to numerically invert ill-conditioned matrices, thus don't be alarmed if the ```∆elbo``` periodically goes negative for stretches, it should always right itself in fairly short order.

### DTM
Now that we have covered static topic models, let's transition to the dynamic topic model (DTM).  The dynamic topic model discovers the temporal-dynamics of topics which, nevertheless, remain thematically static.  A good example of a topic which is thematically-static, yet exhibits an evolving lexicon, is *Computer Storage*.  Methods of data storage have evolved rapidly in the last 40 years, evolving from punch cards, to 5-inch floppy disks, to smaller hard disks, to zip drives and cds, to dvds and platter hard drives, and now to flash drives, solid-state drives and cloud storage, all accompanied by the rise and fall of computer companies which manufacture (or at one time manufactured) these products.

As an example, let's load the Macintosh corpus of articles, drawn from the magazines *MacWorld* and *MacAddict*, published between the years 1984 - 2005.  We sample 400 articles randomly from each year, and break time periods into 2 year intervals.

```julia
import Distributions.sample

srand(1)

maccorp = readcorp(:mac)

maccorp.docs = vcat([sample(filter(doc -> round(doc.stamp / 100) == y, maccorp.docs), 400, replace=false) for y in 1984:2005]...)

fixcorp!(maccorp, b=100, len=10) # Remove words which appear < 100 times and documents of length < 10.

basemodel = LDA(maccorp, 9)
train!(basemodel, iter=150, chkelbo=151)

# training...

macdtm = DTM(maccorp, 9, 200, basemodel)
train!(macdtm, iter=10) # This will likely take about an hour on a personal computer.
                        # Convergence for all other models is worst-case quadratic,
                        # while DTM convergence is linear or at best super-linear.
# training...
```

We can look at a particular topic slice by writing:

```julia
showtopics(macdtm, topics=4, cols=6)
```

```

As you may have noticed, the dynamic topic model is *extremely* computationally intensive, it is likely that running the DTM model on an industry-sized dataset will always require more computational power than can be provided by your standard personal computer.

### CTPF
For our final model, we take a look at the collaborative topic Poisson factorization (CTPF) model.  CTPF is a collaborative filtering topic model which uses the latent thematic structure of documents to improve the quality of document recommendations beyond what would be achievable using just the document-user matrix.  This blending of thematic structure with known user prefrences not only improves recommendation accuracy, but also mitigates the cold-start problem of recommending to users never-before-seen documents.  As an example, let's load the CiteULike dataset into a corpus and then randomly remove a single reader from each of the documents.

```julia
import Distributions.sample

srand(1)

citeucorp = readcorp(:citeu)

testukeys = Int[]
for doc in citeucorp
    index = sample(1:length(doc.readers), 1)[1]
    push!(testukeys, doc.readers[index])
    deleteat!(doc.readers, index)
    deleteat!(doc.ratings, index)
end
```

**Important:** We refrain from fixing our corpus in this case, first because the CiteULike dataset is pre-packaged and thus pre-fixed, but more importantly, because removing user keys from documents and then fixing a corpus may result in a re-ordering of its user dictionary, which would in turn invalidate our test set.

After training, we will evaluate model quality by measuring our model's success at imputing the correct user back into each of the document libraries.

It's also worth noting that after removing a single reader from each document, 158 of the documents now have 0 readers:

```julia
sum([isempty(doc.readers) for doc in citeucorp]) # = 158
```

Fortunately, since CTPF can if need be depend entirely on thematic structure when making recommendations, this poses no problem for the model.

Now that we have set up our experiment, we instantiate and train a CTPF model on our corpus.  Furthermore, since we're not interested in the interpretability of the topics, we'll instantiate our model with a larger than usual number of topics (K=30), and then run it for a relatively short number of iterations (iter=20).

```julia
srand(1)

citeuctpf = CTPF(citeucorp, 30) # Note: If no 'basemodel' is entered then parameters will be initialized at random.
train!(citeuctpf, iter=20)

# training...
```

Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of our model against the test set, where baseline for mean accuracy is 0.5.

```julia
acc = Float64[]
for (d, u) in enumerate(testukeys)
    rank = findin(citeuctpf.drecs[d], u)[1]
    nrlen = length(citeuctpf.drecs[d])
    push!(acc, (nrlen - rank) / (nrlen - 1))
end

@show mean(acc) # mean(acc) = 0.908
```

Not bad, but let's see if we can't improve our accuracy at least a percentage point or two by priming our CTPF model with a 100 iteration LDA model.

In the interest of time, let's use the GPU accelerated verions of LDA and CTPF:


```julia
srand(1)

basemodel = gpuLDA(citeucorp, 30)
train!(basemodel, iter=100, chkelbo=101)

# training...

citeuctpf = gpuCTPF(citeucorp, 30, basemodel)
train!(citeuctpf, iter=20, chkelbo=21)

# training...
```

Again we evaluate the accuracy of our model against the test set:

```julia
acc = Float64[]
for (d, u) in enumerate(testukeys)
    rank = findin(citeuctpf.drecs[d], u)[1]
    nrlen = length(citeuctpf.drecs[d])
    push!(acc, (nrlen - rank) / (nrlen - 1))
end

@show mean(acc) # mean(acc) = 0.920
```

We can see that, on average, our model ranks the true hidden reader in the top 8% of all non-readers for each document.

Let's also take a look at the top recommendations for a particular document(s):

```julia
testukeys[1] # = 216
acc[1] # = 0.945

showdrecs(citeuctpf, 1, 307, cols=1)
```
```
 ●●● Doc: 1

304. #user5486
305. #user261
306. #user4999
307. #user216
```
as well as those for a particular user(s):

```julia
showurecs(citeuctpf, 216, 1745)
```
```

1745. The metabolic world of Escherichia coli is not small
```

We can also take a more holistic and informal approach to evaluating model quality.

Since large heterogenous libraries make the qualitative assessment of recommendations difficult, let's search for a user with a modestly sized relatively focused library: 
```julia
showlibs(citeuctpf, 1741)
```

## GPU Acceleration
GPU accelerating your model runs its performance bottlenecks on the GPU rather than the CPU.

There's no reason to instantiate the GPU models directly, instead you can simply instantiate the normal version of a supported model, and then use the `@gpu` macro to train it on the GPU:

```julia
nsfcorp = readcorp(:nsf)

nsflda = LDA(nsfcorp, 16)
@time @gpu train!(nsflda, iter=150, chkelbo=151) # Let's time it as well to get an exact benchmark. 

# training...

# 238.117185 seconds (180.46 M allocations: 11.619 GB, 4.39% gc time)
# On a 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 2012 Macbook Pro with 4GB of RAM and an Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB GPU.
```

This algorithm just crunched through a 16 topic 128,804 document topic model in *under* 4 minutes.

**Important:** Notice that we didn't check the ELBO at all during training.  While you can check the ELBO if you wish, it's recommended that you do so infrequently since checking the ELBO for GPU models requires expensive transfers between GPU and CPU memory.

Here is the benchmark of our above model against the equivalent NSF LDA model run on the CPU:
![GPU Benchmark](https://github.com/esproff/TopicModelsVB.jl/blob/master/images/ldabar.png)

As we can see, the GPU LDA model is approximatey 1.35 orders of magnitude faster than the equivalent CPU LDA model.

It's often the case that one does not have sufficient VRAM to hold the entire model in GPU memory at one time.  Thus we provide the option of batching GPU models in order to train much larger models than would otherwise be possible:

```julia
citeucorp = readcorp(:citeu)

citeuctm = CTM(citeucorp, 7)
@gpu 4250 train!(citeuctm, iter=150, chkelbo=25) # batchsize = 4250 documents.

# training...
```

It's important to understand that GPGPU is still the wild west of computer programming.  The performance of batched models depends on many architecture dependent factors, including but not limited to the memory, the GPU, the manufacturer, the type of computer, what other applications are running, whether a display is connected, etc.

While non-batched models will usually be the fastest (for those GPUs which can handle them), it's not necessarily the case that reducing the batch size will result in a degredation in performance.  Thus it's always a good idea to experiment with different batch sizes, to see which sizes work best for your computer.

**Important:** If Julia crashes or throws an error when trying to run one of the models on your GPU, then your best course of action is to reduce the batch size and retrain your model.

Finally, expect your computer to lag when training on the GPU, since you're effectively siphoning off its rendering resources to fit your model.

# Train one of the following models: LDA, fLDA, CTM, fCTM.
# 'iter'    - maximum number of iterations through the corpus.
# 'tol'     - absolute tolerance for ∆elbo as a stopping criterion.
# 'niter'   - maximum number of iterations for Newton's and interior-point Newton's methods.
# 'ntol'    - tolerance for change in function value as a stopping criterion for Newton's and interior-point Newton's methods.
# 'viter'   - maximum number of iterations for optimizing variational parameters (at the document level).
# 'vtol'    - tolerance for change in variational parameter values as stopping criterion.
# 'chkelbo' - number of iterations between ∆elbo checks (for both evaluation and convergence checking).
